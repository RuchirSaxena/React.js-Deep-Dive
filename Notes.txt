React JS
==============
React JS is a library for building expressive UI's.

Components
===============
-Components are Like Fuctions,
In React Components returns HTLM which is then rendered in the browser.
-Components are Reusable
-Can have private state that hold data , which may change over time

Reactive updates
======================
-React will automatically react ie. whenever there is a change in the state of a component it will automatically will be reflected unlike JS where we have to manully need to update  the DOM elements
-Take updates to the browser.

Virtual DOM in memmory
===========================
- Write HTML in Javascript 
Using Javascript to render HTML helps React to keep a copy of it as Virtual DOM and ,
later it will only update the part of that DOM rather than the whole DOM , this process
is called as Tree reconcilation.



Types of React Component
==========================
1.Functional Component =>Fuction component cannot have state
2.Class Component =>Class component can have state

Example of a simple  Function Component
=======================================
const Button = function(props) {
  return (
    <button>{props.text}</button>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<Button text="Hello" />, mountNode);

Example of a simple  Class Component
======================================
class ButtonCounter extends React.Component{
  state ={ counter:0};
  handleClick=()=>{
    this.setState({
    	counter: this.state.counter + 1
    })
    //can also be rewritten as below to improve performance :
     this.setState((prevState)=>( {
    	counter: prevState.counter + 1
    }));
  };
	render() {
      return (
          <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
          {this.state.counter}
          </button>
      );
  }
}


ReactDOM.render(<ButtonCounter /> , mountNode);



Note: Component properties i.e.props  are im-mutable and Functional Components can only have props , Class Component can have props as well as state.

Rules with Component 
==========================================
1. Component can return only one element ie. render method can only return 
one HTML container tag.
ReactDOM.render(
    <div>
        <App />
        <DynamicCounter />
    </div>,
    document.getElementById('root'));

Above , App component and DynamicCounter component are wrapped inside Div tag as render method can only return one element.    

2.Component cannot share its state outside ie. state of the component cannot be accesed outside

class DynamicCounter extends Component{
    state={counter :0} ;
    increaseCounter =()=>{
        this.setState((prevState)=>({
            counter: prevState.counter + 1
        }));
       
    }
    render() {
        return(
            <div>
                Hello this is a Dynamic Component.
                <button onClick={this.increaseCounter}>{this.state.counter}</button>
            </div>
            
        );
    }
}

In Above Example  state={counter :0} ; cannot be accessed outside DynamicCounter component. 

3.Diffrent ways of accesing props in Functional and Class component =>
In Functional Component =>{props.value}
In Class Component =>{this.props.value}

4.Diffrent ways of calling functions with argument
  1st way:
  <button onClick={()=>{this.props.onClickFunction(this.props.incrementValue)}}> 

  2nd way:
   handleClick=()=>{
       this.props.onClickFunction(this.props.incrementValue);
   }
   <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        +{this.props.incrementValue}
   </button> 

 Props and State
===================
1.The input for the component is props ie. set of value properties that can be passed to a component , the props cannot be chaanged by the component but a whole component can be re-created by diffrent props vlaues ie.Reusable Component
2.A component state can be changed inside the component only using the setState() method and every time a component changes its state a component re-renders itself
